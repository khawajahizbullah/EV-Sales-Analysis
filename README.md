# EV Sales Analysis 🚗⚡

This project is part of my **15-Day Data & Business Analysis Challenge**.
On **Day 3**, I analyzed the **Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales dataset** using **Python, Pandas, and Seaborn** to uncover insights about market growth, EV adoption trends, and sales distribution.

## 📂 Dataset

* Source: Kaggle – EV Sales by Country (2010–2022)
* Columns: `Year`, `Country`, `Region`, `EV_Type (BEV/PHEV)`, `Value (Sales)`

---

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handled missing values
   * Converted `year` and `value` to integer types
   * Removed unrealistic values & outliers

2. **Descriptive Analysis**

   * Counted unique countries, years, EV types
   * Summarized sales distribution (mean, median, quartiles)
   * Identified skewness in sales values

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * EV market growth over years (line plot)
   * BEV vs. PHEV comparison (bar chart)
   * Regional adoption trends (China, Europe, USA)
   * Year-on-Year growth analysis (YoY % change)

---

## 📊 Key Insights

* EV sales are growing year by year, showing strong upward momentum
* BEVs consistently outsell PHEVs
* **China and Europe** lead in EV adoption globally
* EV sales growth fluctuates due to policies, subsidies, and consumer demand
* Growth peaked around **500% in 2011**, then stabilized to ~150% the next year, surged above **100% in 2021**, and dropped again afterward
